<h3>Retro Games!</h3>

<p>A long time ago when i learned kids java programming, i've created this simple pack of games for understanding how basicly games is working</p>

<h4>In current time project contains:</h4>
<div>
<ol>
    <li>Ping-Pong</li>
    <li>Snake</li>
    <li>Space Invaders (partially, i'm still rewriting it)</li>
<ol>
</div>

<p>Project also had support for <b>Maven</b>, so you can easily build it after running: <i><b>mvn package </b></i></p>
