<p>A long time ago when i learned kids java programming.</p>
<p>I've created this simple pack of games for understanding how basicly games is working</p>

<h4>In current time project contains:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Ping-Pong</li>
    <li>Snake</li>
    <li>Space Invaders (partially, i'm still rewriting it)</li>
<ol>

<p>Project also had support for Maven, so you can easily build it after running: <i>mvn package </i></p>
